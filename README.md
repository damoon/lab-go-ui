# go ui lab

- gogl includes access to opengl
- GoKi & GoGi / oak are based on shiny
- sdl uses cgo bindings

- sdl uses 10-15% of a core just to run
- shiny based libraries have no visible overhead in idle mode
- gogl does a lot more then the other examples and used around 5% cpu (and some gpu i asume)
- shiny as an experimantal module is no longer maintained
- oak and goki each maintain a fork of shiny
- fyne uses about 3-5% cpu idle
